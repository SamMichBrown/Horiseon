# Horiseon
My Horiseon Website Challenge Contribution.

Included: All source files (html, css, images).
This README.

## Goal
To refactor the given source code for accessability, for the user, the client, and anyone who would wish to work on the code in the future.

## The Process

I began by adding descriptors to each individual section through-out the HTML and CSS code, and adding a proper title. 

I found a small error in the original code, where the search-engine-optimization href did not link to the search-engine-optimization <div> in the hero section.
I ammended this by giving it a proper id tag.

I then proceeded to add the proper alt tags to the corrisponding images.
Each detailed image recieved a description, where as the simple symbol images were left blank.

## The Result
After refactoring the original source code, I believe I have successfully added a great amount of accessability to the Website and its inner workings.
